#Completed 
User has many mixes
mixes have many revisions





#TODO:
changes have a time range and a description

changes can have critic tagged, or not

each revision has a thread where critics and artists can converse(linearly)

mixes have many critic requests(with $ offers)

Render Critiques show/create via jQuery

user can specify who they would like as a critic by traits(good with snare compression, certain genres)
